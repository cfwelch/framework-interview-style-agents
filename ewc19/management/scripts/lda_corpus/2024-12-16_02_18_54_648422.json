["It sounds like a great invention to study brain development, model neurological diseases and test drugs. This tech will help scientists understand more human brains and how to develop it and why not control it.. At the moment, that.s my opinion.. This idea is not only great but it will change our persective regarding so mny things. I am very excited to get more familiar with the study.. Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease are progressive brain diseases caused by gradual damage to brain cells. Each of these conditions has its own set of symptoms, stages, and treatments. The thought of a potential new treatments for these brain diseases is very exciting. The study of the brain is such a fascinating thing that would help alot in the future in order to develop treatments.. Positive thinking helps me alot with stress management and can even improve my mental and physical health. A positive person focuses on what's good in their life, finds joy in the simple things, and takes the general attitude that while there are lots of things they can't directly control, they can control what they choose to focus on.. The more research being conducted on the humain brain, the more organoid would be close to the real human brains. It would take some time, but the more complex the humain brain would b\u00e9 the more organoid will ressemble it. I don\u2019t think there is any boundries not to cross. There always should be a challenge in order to reach better results.. I believe in science and i know that this new research would help us alot in the future as humans in so many fields not only the medical field.. Brain organoids offer a new platform for scientists to study brain development, neurological diseases, drug discovery and personalized medicine, regenerative medicine, and so on.. It makes me feel very excited to see what the future will hod for us in this field.. No, personally i don\u2019t think there would be any ethical trade offs that i feel conflicted about.. Ethics is an important consideration in science. Scientific investigations and studies must be guided by what is right and what is wrong. That's where ethical rules come in. They help ensure that science is done safely and that scientific knowledge is reliable.. My core moral beliefs and convictions are very persuaded by my attitude on brain organoids.. It makes me feel very excited to see what the future will hold for us in this field.. Even though i don\u2019t have a vast knoweldge about the brain organoids, but i can say that this research is quite brilliant and informative. Not only it will help develop new treatments and ledical discoveries, but it will help understanding more how the real human brain works.. Good luck :D", "Can you tell me more about it ?. Not sure. I think this is going to be a big step in humanity if it even works. Yes, because if this kind of biotechnology works great it's going to be expensive, and in that way the rich will get it first, meaning it will make more difference between the layers of society !. As an engineee I think try ti re-engineer the human brain is a great deal, but as a person I feel that this won't work. For my be. About what ?. Of course, if I know that they 100% effective in this kind of treatment, I would say that my belief about it was wrong, and this is something revolutionairy. No. No boudries I want to see where does this kind of thing will lead the humanity to, maybe a better futur. I know some people that are against this kind of biotechnlogy because of religious or ethical problems, but for me it's better that we see where it could lead to first. It's something new for the humanity, if we can use this think carefully, it will the greatest search and invention since the start of humanity. I already told you. This is not a question. Can you ?. For me this is a boost for my beliefs and convictions, because I believe in science and this kind of thing is good. Yes for the feedback part, when starting this convo, the C.P. just welcomes you introduces the subject were are talking about, then it just waits", "Is there a question here?. I'm not really sure. I've not heard about them much.. My father would probably not have liked it.. I really haven't considered it enough to have opinions at this point.. Actually, I just said that I haven't put much thought into it.. I think it would be fine.. It doesn't cause me to feel any emotions. ok cool. What's the question. My father would probably not have liked it.. I think they are fine. You seem repetitive.. I'm not sure I can think of any. I don't think it has anything to do with me core beliefs.. Not much to tell. Anything that can help people is good.. Yeah that sounds amazing.. nope", "impressive something like that exist but also confusing. I ask myself how exactly a brain without a body works. where does it get its impulses from or for what it could be helpful. for me its difficult to separate a working organ from a living body, so I'm not sure what how to imagine a lab-created brain. I'm sure such science can be helpful to test meds or simplify access to organs for scientists. confused. it's great they can be helpful. also it might reduce animal testing. I think I am somehow detached from this topic because I don't need the kind of medical treatment. but as someone who is mostly interested in scientifically breakthroughs. I think as long as science does more good than bad it is good to keep working on it. this seems to do mostly good for humans and maybe animal due to a potential decrease in animal testing, so it should be okay to work on brain organoids. but one should keep looking at the well being and complexity of the brains to make sure they are not been harmed. there are always people trying to help others. if it is possible to tell if they are thinking or even feeling without help from scientist they would be too close to a human in my opinion. if they are autonomous one should ask if they have something to say about their situation. the moment a brain can think autonomously it should have its own rights in regards to free will. probably I have watched to many movies about advanced ai systems which go crazy so I'm assuming brain organoids can go crazy too. my thoughts are not based on science but on imagination. no", "They are a great thing! Yey organoids!. I support them and support everyone who uses and develops. It will helps develop a new techniques in the science field that will probably help saving lives and improve our understanding regarding many things. I don\u2019t agree as this will have a negative impact on many levels. After all we don\u2019t know what that animal would think or feel, which can causes really bad consequences. What concerns me is the consequences of this technology not only on the animal, which his body might not accept tge tissue, but also on humans, many people won\u2019t accept this technology and not to mention that what will this technology will be used for later, i mean bad people are everywhere!. If vrain organoids can save people \u00b4s life one day, then i am all in and i support it fully. Not to mention, that it would help us understand more how the brain works and maybe how we can guide it to develop other useful technologies.. I support such idea! It would probably be crucial for closing knowledge gaps about health and disease in both humans and animals. Understanding cell and organ function helps researchers design experiments to test new treatments in people.. Yes! The use of animals in research is essential for enabling researchers to develop new drugs and treatments. The use of animals in the lab has dramatically improved scientists' understanding of human biology and health. Animal models help ensure the effectiveness and safety of new treatments.. Despite the promising features of human brain organoids, their broad utility is tempered by a variety of limitations yet to be overcome, including developing an informed consent model for donors participating in organoid research and the potential to commercialize organoids. Nope", "there are ethical considerations surrounding the use of human brain organoids, particularly as they become more advanced and resemble the human brain more closely.. brain organoids are not the same as a living human brain and have limitations in terms of their complexity and capabilities.. from a scientific perspective, brain organoids have the potential to greatly advance our understanding of the human brain and its development, as well as potentially leading to new treatments for neurological disorders. However, it's important to note that they are not the same as a living human brain and have limitations in terms of their complexity and capabilities, and their use also raises ethical considerations.. i dont mind it. The use of brain organoids raises a number of ethical considerations, particularly as they become more advanced and resemble the human brain more closely. One of the main concerns is the potential for brain organoids to develop consciousness or sentience, which would raise questions about their moral status and how they should be treated. Additionally, there are concerns about the use of human stem cells in the creation of brain organoids, as well as the potential for the organoids to be used for controversial research, such as the development of new weapons or for creating \"designer\" brains for specific purposes. These questions have not been fully addressed and are still a subject of ongoing ethical debate.. i already told you bro. One of the main concerns is the potential for brain organoids to develop consciousness or sentience, which would raise questions about their moral status and how they should be treated. Additionally, there are concerns about the use of human stem cells in the creation of brain organoids, as well as the potential for the organoids to be used for controversial research, such as the development of new weapons or for creating \"designer\" brains for specific purposes.. no it is still the same. basically the same as using animals in any other lab experiment which is harmfull to the animals. you cannot guarentee that. but lets suppose they are, are there any counter measures to this research if it becames dangerous?. no there are not. thank you for your time", "My initial reaction is whaat the fuuckk! This sounds actually pretty scary to me in the first moment because I don't know what will be the side effects of this and to what extent this can be misused. Also this is another level in connecting humans and technology. I'm not sure how this invention can be controlled properly without causing much ethical conflicts.. Hmm I don't really know, but for what I can tell in the first moment. It is an unknown realm for me, which I don't know about and this makes me feel scared about it. Also because I am not a big fan of a permanent progress in technology without thinking of the ethical or moral aspects.. Why would you do such a thing? I don't understand it. What purpose does is serve?. Well I do think it is in conflict with some of my principles. For example human life should not me manipulated or extended because life is fleeting and there are limits to any good invention. So good things will also have a bad effect. Also the meaning of life kind of gets lost. This makes me think of questions like, what is natural, what is human, what is real, what is good, what is right, what is wrong. Its a deeply philosophical question, which I think should be considered more than just trying to improve life all the time!. I dont think this would change my perspective. Only if the benefits would be free and freely accessible for everyone no matter from which class or financial status you come. But I don't believe there will ever be equal distribution in this world.. No this also wouldn't change my perspective, because for me it's about having clear boundaries between different species of life and not mingling these.. I think it would be important to know exactly what it will be used for, in what areas and for what purposes.. Your amazing bruh.", "I think it sounds really interesting and potentially useful as a tool to study the human body, disease, medicine, neuroscience, etcetera. Connecting organoids to a computer sounds kind of bizarre. I'm not sure how that will work or what kind of information will be transmitted or how that is different than simply connecting sensors to the organoids to measure information. If the difference is that the organoid will also receive information from the computer, I'm not sure why. Why would that be useful? I know there is some concern about creating part of a living thing that can think and feel and how that might be unethical. The artificial creation a living thing that has only a painful experience of life seems like a new thing, but the closest, ethically similar things from human history I think are widely considered unethical or fall under the definition of torture, so I think it is important to understand what people are doing.. Yeah, there are a few parts to what I said before, so I'll try to elaborate on each. The usefulness for understanding human biology seems clearer to me than the negative implications. I think that if we can create these simulations of organs under different conditions and stages of development and we can experiment with them without harming people (i.e. the organs are not inside of a person), then we can learn a lot faster and try more things which I anticipate leading to things like cancer treatments, treatments for things like heart disease, Alzheimers, diabetes, and other diseases.. Well, yes, what I wanted to elaborate a bit more on was the negative implications. I know that there is potential to create a living thing that may have some level of consciousness and is suffering because of the experiments that are being carried out. I don't understand very well how different life forms could exist that would not experience suffering. Overall, creating suffering I think is wrong by most moral theories unless there is a great enough benefit. For example, if the experiment cures cancer then it may be worth it. As a non-expert and someone not in the field, I would just want to know that the experiments being carried out are ethical and are being monitored to the best of our ability to avoid unnecessary suffering. The same thing applies to chimeras. I'm sure there are a lot of benefits, but we should not create suffering.. I don't think that my attitude has really changed. I think that you just have a fuller picture now. I started with the positives and then I answered more about the negatives later. I don't think it has changed. I think I might need more information to be able to change my opinion. I suppose if I had not reflected on this as much in the past, my current notes may have caused a shift in overall stance.. I think that if I didn't already know about that, it would change my perspective, though it's hard to say from my current position.. Yeah, definitely. I think that is the key issue for me. If they're being treated well and there is some assessment of how the treatment will impact the suffering of the animals and it is expected that they will not suffer, then it is okay. I think this is probably a difficult thing to predict for some operations. There will always be things that don't go as expected, but people should still take it seriously and we should do our best.. I guess not really. I have been talking at a relatively high level about suffering, which is pretty broad and might encompass all of my concerns. I haven't talked about all of my specific concerns though. As we've been talking about suffering, I've been thinking about it in terms of the negative impacts of having organs that are incompatible with the host body, or having experiments done on them that are painful. There are other forms of suffering that could occur though. Maybe more in the form of trauma or altering the function of a brain in an antisocial/destructive way. Then also if it leads to some treatment for brains or some more far-off technologies that might enhance or augment human anatomy, there will be class disparity and this could lead to wider inequality, which is a more indirect cause of suffering.. Nope! Thanks!", "it sound like science fiction. but it is interesting. I would like to know what this new technology is for... is there a way to test medical treatments on organdies? or use them for exploring the functions of the human brain?. if they can be used to test medical procedures I think it is good to keep developing them. also if there is a way to use organdies instead of rats. I think of myself of an atheist. that means there are no religious constraints for me when thinking about scientific development. but I can see how growing uo in a western society might make myself less worried about science, since our nations are the ones doing it. And there certainly are examples were I think science goes to far, like when we are destroying existing species to create new ones. I think realistically private companies will have to work on research because they have the money. Competition could help distributing resources, since there would be more people working on this. but I would like to see people with different background doing so.. I would be interested in the outcome of such an experiment but I'm not sure if I can support that ethically. I would if there was a way to ask the animals for permissi<br/>on. I think it is k to develop brain organoids. the only I have is that I don't know if they can be sentient. maybe if one works with brain organoid one should somehow check for signals of the brain being okay or becoming too human. I think it's important to develop effective drugs. but animal testing is already morally grey. I think it would be great if could skip the animals entirely. I think. I think like the brain is unique and central to each person, so it is strange to think of a brain without a body. its like having a person without a body. I would like to know how far these developments already are", "At first i think of the Future and the the possibilities of us as Humans changing the Nature. This brings new possibilities but also new enviromental dangers. Brain organoids could from my Point of View be used in many was to become aome sort of new smart Computer.. I think as an Atheist its more likely to Not condemn new technology but the problematic of where a human begins is Something that should bei openly discussed in our society.. Honestly No they dont, but i get nervous when i think of selfaware brains Just working and suffer. But i also See possibilities of new Bio Computers and much more. My core moral belief is above all else, that the we must embrace the Future for It will come to us No Matter what.. Well i Think privat companies are Essential for new technology that will Benefit the puplic. But the useage of such technology should bei discussed in the puplic and Not be used  without the knowledge of the puplic.. I dont See the upsides of doing such a Thing honestly i dont See the Point. But If there would be a good reason for maybe ln the medical area then sure do what you can do.. Yes this is Something i can understand and If its possible to Safe lifes then yes we should use such technology.. This reminds me of an Anime but yes this is Something i can Approve. This Sound Like interesting Research and i am interested in learning more about IT.. Yes i am concerned about hybrid between a human and a Dog for example but No i dont See any more Problems in this Direktion.. Is this Research real?", "It sounds like science fiction. the ethics of creating life have been discussed over decade and combining biomass with computers seems to me like it could produce a organism that does not need human help or interference to function. There is also the question of why. Why would you do such a thing? does it produce a better functioning and more efficient network? Does it help humankind in any way?. I feel this way because I know the human brain isn't understood well enough to explain how we work as humans. So I think this could help our understanding of brains and how to cure neurological diseases like dementia. But if it is used to enhance efficiency and optimize controlling the flow of information in the internet for example I can see how it could be exploited for profit while being a contentious topic. Because creating and the combining parts of a human with a machine without directly helping humankind seems exploitative to me, even though these parts are not taken from someone and do not qualify as a living being. It is complicated and I do not know enough about the topic to be really emotionally invested.. First of all I think all research done by university projects should be available to the public and in line with the publics interest. So this research should aim to create a useful and ethically sound product. For this reason I think this kind of research should be conducted in a publicly owned organization and only become part of the private sector when there are informed regulations what should be done with this kind of research. The private sector is very good in distributing new technologies but it tends to forget the needs of the lower class which does not have the buying power to influence the market in a way which benefits them.. I think our way to look at scientifically created human cells and maybe human-like organism will change over the course of the next few decades. Already there is a heated discussion over the ethics of in vitro fertilization and donor organs grown in a lab. If we can \"become gods\" maybe it will create new ways to define our relationship with the divine and spirituality. I'm not religious, though I sometimes feel something is quite spiritual, but I think a lot of it is human group think and the communities we create to feel better and organize ourselves. I think this will be true even if we redefine our relationship as subjects to the divine because of our newfound power over creation. My personal background does allow me to accept this new research on a religious level, for I do not believe we humans have something unique like a soul which is not there in a scientifically grown human part, but I do think we have a sense of community and right and wrong which must be instilled in all the research for it to benefit us.. we should create rules before research can hurry along. Protective legislature and education needs to be a priority. We should aim to make things last, not hurry along without stopping to ask why and what for. concerning nature, I think it is but a definition. we already influenced and changed nature so profoundly that growing human parts seems quite small to me. We have to discuss publicly if there is a need and want to actually create a being that can think on it's own.I think if there is a potential for humans or organdies to suffer we should stop the research immediately. no not necessarily.. I have concerns about exploitation of the technology and the network. I am not concerned about growing human parts, but what might come of it. i see the potential for many things to improve, but I also think research often hurrays along without listening to differing views. I do not know how far along and how well these organoids work with each other, but for example the current problems we face with A.I. technology in that the public is completely underprepared to protect their data from scraping shows me that a more efficient and complex network that can learn, change and distribute information rapidly does not have to be good.. Again, is there the possibility for suffering disproportional to the gain. I feel like no-one would really gain anything from this. The animal would suffer, and humans cannot really transplant their being into an animal. But maybe there is the possibility to grow parts of human brains in animals. I do not know enough about this topic. I feel like there should be other ways to do this.. Yes I believe that would be acceptable. I'm not against using lab animals and I think it is similar to growing other organs in animals. The brain is essential to the human existence but transplanting parts of it into animals does not make the animal a human.. I do not care if they are treated better for I do not distinguish in this regard. There needs to be a good reason and developing drugs seems to be a good one. Lab animals should all be treated as well as possible.. No.. no", "The question is where if at all we can draw the line between a living organism and lumb of cells. If can grow a human brain in a petri dish for research that might be interesting but it should be closely monitored and acompanied or supervised by an ethics board. Personally I think growing a brain in the Lab is in many ways similar to using lab rats for research. I think you should problably not do it if there is not a good reason for it but I would consider relevant resarch to be a good reason.. I do think there is a scary potentaial to the development of organoids. We do not want to create conscious beeings that have to live thier live in a petri dish until we deem they have served their purpose. To my knowledge a Brain itselve can not feel pain. Otherwiese this would be of concern as I think inflictiong pain should be avoided even on something that we created and that is not alive. I think the fear comes from the Idea that one day we might not only grow single organs but conscious beeings in labs and at first I feel this should be avoided. Then again, growing a small animal like a rat in the lab is not worse then using live rats as we currently do. <br/>\n\nBut currently the idea of creating living organsisms in the lab to use them as test subjects is far away.growing single organs for research does seem justified. But again, it should be done with great care to avoid abuse of the technology.. As private compalnies aim for profit and do often not care about ethical boundaries that do not alingn with their financial interest, I think introducing the technology to open markets is undesireable unless the market is properly regulated. Proper regulation is key here. Introducing a bioethics board that supervises and monitors activity of a (limited) number of private companies might be one aspect of proper regulation.. Organoids do challenge our way of defining live that is worthy of protection. This is of course a very relevant discussion also in the context of abortion and animal protection. It might be one of the most basic questions of live: To whom or what do we have resposiblities and duties? Thus this can inspire a philosophical discourse but it is not a new discussion. <br/>\nTo the last question: Yes of course my background and experiences shaped the person I am and the opinions I have today.. I am not sure about the scientific value of such a transplantation. Currently I am not for such a transplantation but I suppose if the scientific merit of such a experiment can be shown sufficiently I would not oppose the idea completly. A core value of mine is that you should not cause unnecessary harm. But I do not see organoids infringing on that as they are not alive and (to my knowledge) do not feel pain.. This certainly changes the situation but I thaink the conclusion that brain organoids can be ethically applied in certain situations would not change. This would however certainly be a situation where the use of organoids can be justified if done under proper supervision.. No animals should suffer no matter if they have human brain cells implanted into them or not. Of course this is not always possible and sometimes we have to make certain sacrifices for the greater good but I do not see a reason to treat lab animals with human cells better than others.. No. No", "That sounds both exiting and scary. On one hand it might bring us closer to understanding the human brain. On the other hand it is hard to decide what is human and what isnt and then decide how to deal with the ethics of tests on humans. I feel like we understand so little of how life works that it is hard to know if there is any harm being caused in the experiments.. As I said it's hard to say where cells in a lab start being life and should be treated with the ethics that we use for humans and other animals. If we don't know what exactly we are dealing with it might be hard to figure out how we can interact with the subject at hand without causing harm. On the other hand it can be very important for humanity as a whole to learn more about the human brain and how it works. Or maybe be able to recreate parts of the Brain that got damaged through cancer and the likes.. I think especially on the religious aspects it can be tough. The creation of life is something very special in the eyes of religious people I think so there could be some resistance on that part. As for the cultural and philosophical views I am not sure how research in that field would impact them at all.<br/>\nAs a non religious peorson I think I am more open to the idea of creating life than others might be. To me the main issue would be to choose when life begins and how we are going to treat the cells created in a lab.. I don't think that private companies should have their hands in this kind of research. I think it would keep benefits from most of the public for the most part.. I think we would need to know more about how brains function before that would be ethical. Until we understand what kind of impact that could have on both the animal and the human brain and thoughts that come from there I would not be comfortable with that kind of research. For other parts of the human body I do not see any issues though.. in general they do not but I think it is a subject where caution is advised because there is so much we don't know. Research in the field should not be conducted lightly and researchers should think about the potential consequences of their actions on an ethical basis beforehand.. Probably not. I think the brain is a really sesitive part of the human body. As far as I understand it everything we are is in the brain. So as long as we don't understand the potential consequences of putting part of one animals brain into another I think we should be hesitant.. If there was a way we could guarantee the animals were not suffering I would not see an issue with it. I can't think of a way that would be doable though. In general I think animal testing is imporant but it should not be done lightly.. The lack of understanding we have about the human brain in general. I don't think there is currently a way for us to measure if a brain is suffering. And not being able to but an organism out of its misery because we don't know it is suffering sounds really dangerous to me.. No. Thank you very much.", "These are great! Tell me more!. I think they sound promising and cloud help many humans.. Prople with brain damage or cancer may get a brain organoid to continue there normal life. It may be concering if it also used to improve healthy people to a posthuman level.. Persona\u00f6 backgorund often impacts our opinion, it is imposible to get rid if this. I think a better understanding of the brain will always help us tp embrace diffenences in culture, religions and philosophy.. I am not sure about that. The most important thing for me is that no suffering is created. It is unclear how much brain you can transplant before it start to be a human mouse hybrid.. Research need to be open for everyone. As long as companies need to publish there results and have a ethic board this should work.As most of the profit of research is privatized any way it is hard to tell. Large technologies should be controlled by the government.. No they do not conflict with my beliefs. There might be some case were I have concerns, but in general I would promote a improvment in such a technology. This depends on the scale of the animals used, IF it is just a few animals I a fine with it, but if it would require million animals to suffer I think we should look for alternatives.. Is depends on the amount of human cells. Is the able to be awake? I think it is no big difference untl a certained point of consciousness.. If it adds suffering I think there can be a better way. You suggest to get organoids animal suffering is neseccary, I do not hope so.. Yes introducing suffering and the pressure to build super humans.. no", "I think they're really exciting. I could definitely see some benefits to them but there could also be potential harms in the wrong hands. So I'd say we should be cautious about their development.. The reason is that it's a very sensitive issue. The technology could help cure brain diseases in human beings. However, bad actors could also develop super humans that are prone to manipulation and only follow orders. Who knows? It might get out of hand and pose risks to human beings.. It's certainly a challenge for the followers of certain religions and philosophies since they don't accept this kind of activities because of their belief that only God can and should play this role. However, if we think about helping people with brain problems and finding out that the only way to do that is by using brain organoids, I believe it's worth trying. This is also somewhat accepted where I come from so I might have been under the influence of my cultural background but I think it's more of a self-discovery.. The involvement of the private sector and the competition between the players is likely to bring down the prices but I don't think it should be left only to them since usually the only driving factor for them is profit which is not a safe objective. I definitely think that there should be a government oversight to make sure that the competition is aligned with the interests of society.. I'm in favor of a responsible development of this technology. Scientists in this area should be accountable to their research and should definitely follow the accepted ethical rules of the society. Having said that, I don't think banning this kind of research altogether would be beneficial for the society.. I think I've answered this before. In my opinion, it can be beneficial but we should be cautious. I support a responsible development of this technology.. I think you didn't understand my viewpoint. I'm not against it. I already said that I'm for it provided that it's used for only human beings to live a better life.. No. It would actually be a relief. This way, I think, everyone would be happy.. What do you mean?. Yes. Other than the ethical concerts, I also wonder what will happen to the conception of a human being. I think about how much of a human being will be left after the development of this technology.. No. Thanks for your questions.", "Sounds good, i Wunder if these things have some form of consciousness. Indifferent to be honest, it would be fun to see if we could connect arms or legs to pcs and generate organic/computer composite machines. I guess I feel very neutral about them. it probably scares some people who are writing with this bot, but I do not feel scared. I am more intrigued by the idea of connecting machines to human and generating a symbiosis of these parts. We would have to rethink our definition of rights for machines. As we have animal rights and human rights machines might get their own rights if parts of them are biological, and if their brains are biological and have consciousness they would decently be granted some form of rights, dependent on their development status. I think at this point some human cultural pillars might collapse. religion or culture are not really important in a world where we can artificially create other humans/ human brains or human/pc composites. We essentially become creators. therefore our historical views might be for the past. How do you know that I value control over resources?. Like mentioned above, I would find it interesting to transplant human brain cells into monkeys or mice. But since I can not force the results, I do not know if this research is going into the right direction. No, they do not. I do not think that such things are wrong. Since only conducting neutral research on them should not be considered ethically wrong. We are not harming anyone.. My positive views would not change, since the impact of developing and testing drugs on organoids does not harm anyone. For example you could test out a liver medication on a human liver, that has never been inside a human and therefore did not need to be transplanted or taken from somebody that acted as donor. I think these things will have a positive impact. No, since I already exclaimed my positive views on this technology, the recoded suffering would only benefit my opinion. I would still see such a technical advancement as positive. No, i do not think that we are capable of creating human brains, we might generate some form of tissue that is similar to human brain cells, and has similar functionality, but since we are not yet capable of understanding ourselves in terms of brain activity etc, we will not be capable of producing something we do not understand.. No, thank you too CP", "It sounds very useful for health research and thus beneficial for humanity.. No. Well, if scientists can use organoids to grow different parts of the body, they probably can use them to study diseases in a new way and develop cures for them.. I assume some people dislike the creation and use of organoids due to their cultural, religious or philosophical views, but I think with most of this people it is nearly impossible to come to a settlement, because if people are against modern techniques as organoids for religious or cultural reasons, their beliefs are probably most fundamental and thus they will not change their minds. <br/>Still, advantages of organoids for humanity may be a reason to calm such people at least a bit. \nRegarding the second question: Of course my personal background impacts my opinion on ethical questions, given that I choose to spend a lot of time with science, I support scientific progress.. I think competition between researchers would speed up the process, that is what history showed, but it is not a perfect approach since competition also means that individual researchers keep their progress and findings a secret towards others, until they finished the research and can sell it for a lot of money. So, in my eyes, the majority of the public would benefit the most, if the research project is public and from the government, so patents are in the hand of the public and can be given to many companies for a low price and no company can make inappropriate amounts of money on patents of technologies the public needs.. That is a difficult topic, I think if the benefits for many people are high enough, it is okay to do so, but in a very controlled frame, so no unnecessary harm to animals is done.. I am not religious nor really spiritual, so I have no problems with scientific experiments with brain cells under the aspect of a human souls or something like that. Under an other aspect of if that is a cruel thing to do because brain cells might feel something, I say again, if the benefits are high enough, it is okay to do so. Humans create a lot of suffering for much lesser things, that is just the way it is.. I do not feel different about them now, your perception of my attitude may be wrong at some point of this conversation. Nothing about organoids concerns me.. In my eyes, if the benefits of such experiments are high enough, and developing more effective drugs is beneficial enough, that using lab animals with human brain cells is okay, assuming that the suffering of the animals in not to high.. As I reasoned before, I already support the use of lab animals with human brain cells, if the suffering is not to much and the experiments are beneficial for humans.. No, there are no aspects of human brain organoids that I am conflicted about.. No", "I am quite interested in this kind of technology and would like to find out more about its potential as well as its risk. I feel curious. This topic has been dealt with in so many books, movies etc. I think that it could be an important step in creating new technologies as well as in expanding our understanding of what it means to be human. Maybe it would make it also possible to envision new kinds of work where we create a more equal society where less people have to work under at-risk conditions. At the same time I am afraid of the risks. For example, how our culture will develop under the influence of these advanced technologies and if it might bring some risks that we cannot foresee right now.. I think that the involvement of animals has brought significant achievements, especially in the context of modern medicine. Still I don't think that animals should be used against their will and suffer in the name of human technological process.. I want to stay open to new developments in technologies that potentially help people and also shape the way we perceive our shared world and one another. But I also think that at this point I don't know enough about brain organoids to judge whether or not they agree with my core beliefs.. Yes, I think that the use of lab animals is potentially justified in the name of scientific progress. Still I think that it is not within our rights as humans to enslave other animals to use for our advantage. There definitely should be something done about the living conditions of lab animals and our respect towards them as thinking and feeling entities.. Yes, I think that good conditions and lack of suffering would be an important step in the right direction when it comes to using animals for our scientific advantage. Still I wonder how we would make sure that the animals are not suffering. This would be only measurable in the way they show physical distress oder abnormalities. We still wouldn't know what they were thinking and if they were mindful about what was happening to them.. I am not feeling explicitly different about organoids now than in the beginning. But I just learned from your questions that the development of brain organoids would imply the heavy use of lab animals in order to document the development processes. I am very critical about the use of lab animals since the conditions are so bad most of the time. And I don't think that we have sufficient data to make sure that the animals really don't suffer when used as lab animals. I also think that humans have great minds but they falsely think they can shape the world in their image and neglect the needs and lives of so many other inhabitants of the world without any consequences. But still I think that scientific progress is a noble goal which deserves an open mind and the possibility to achieve results under better conditions and generally do better in the future.. There are probably more aspects about human brain organoids that I feel conflicted about, for example the working conditions of the people that make these technologies possible, especially workers in the global south building chips, sourcing metals etc. Also, I would be critical about the way these organoids would be used in our current hypercapitalist society, for example if they were used to generate more wealth for the wealthy and create even bigger gaps between the rich and the poor.. No, only thank you for bringing this topic to my attention today", "It\u2019s a bit scary. The fact that it can be connected to computers scares me. I feel we don\u2019t know enough about AI and should be more careful with all the possibilities it has. I feel like a big part is that I simply don\u2019t know enough to form a good opinion. New technologies are always a bit scary at first. I think we shouldn\u2019t do that because the animals didn\u2019t consent to it. We should avoid animal testing as much as possible. I can understand the scientific curiosity nonetheless some things maybe just shouldn\u2019t be researched. I think in general it doesn\u2019t really conflict my core moral beliefs if its only used to advance medicine and actually help people. On the other hand I feel really strongly about possible animal testing and I think it doesn\u2019t justify the use of animals just for scientific reasons. We also don\u2019t know how advanced this technology can get and if new ethical problems will arise because of that. Even today AI can make itself better even better then human beings and I think we should maybe just pause for a while and think about all the possibilities, the ethical questions and the necessities of these kinds of technologies.. Yes, that would definitely change my views. Even though I still care about the animals, great medical break troughs would be amazing for people suffering from these diseases. But I still think that we should also invest and research about animal free testing models.. I would certainly more approve of it. But I still think that using animals for our own benefits is always selfish and we should always look for better options. Because the animals can never give consent to the testing and we\u2019ll always be (ab-)using them. I don\u2019t have time anymore, sorry. No, thank you", "My First thought: Wtf?. I think it is very interesting to Talk about such topics especially cause this topic is completely new to me and it sounds like a very controvers technology, but also like it could bring more Insight to human biologie. First of all I try to be Open to new Technology or in generell to new Innovations and Ideas. So I try to See both Sides - The pros and cons. So First IT seems very problematic to repuduce Part of tge human brain in a Petri dish, due to The brain used to be the \"core of our Souls\". Nevertheless noone has explaind The mystery to our \"Soul\" or Consciousness yet. So probably it is Just a guess. so F\u00fcrther, why Not use this Method to do better reaserches with the human brain. Maybe it leads to new discoverys in the function, The Treatment of brain diseases. But also it sounds bit terrifying that human artificially produced brains shall be Connected to computers. So I have Mixed Feelings about organiods. To be clear primarely I feel neither negetiv nor positiv about it, my view on it depends on to wich extent the Technology is used in real life and on wich pourpose. It would be a conflict with my Moral core when it is used for Military pourposes to make Like human brain-connected-fight-roboters Kind of Thing.. Just dont do this at all. It sounds Like Humans would try to be Like gods. Nobody knows what would happend to animals. I think this Technology could be used to reduce animal-experemts in medecin science and pharmalogical tests. This is a hard question and The answer would depend on how The organiods Technology would evolve over time. But while thinking about this, I would say No, you shouldnt Transplate human brain cells Into animals.. To Transplate human brains Into animals is Just a ethical Line that should Not be crossed in the use of organiods. Otherwise my view on organoids hasnt changed. That might Sound cruel, but I am Not AS worried about the animals Well being or suffering as I am about the consequences a Human-brain modified animal would Bring. Also with No suffering from the Experiments IT could lead to mental Change (Well i dont know If that can happened, but thats what i am worried about) with in the animal, so maybe IT would lead to suffering anyhow and maybe to Problems with in sociaty. Actually not, cause i allready mentioned all of my concerns about the possible conflicts.. First, thank you for this interesting experience! Btw. The bot seems a Bit unflexibel in its reactions. I dont mean, that IT doesnt answer to questions, but IT feels Like it cant distinguish nuances in the View of the Person answering. The conversation allready feels very Natural, but there ist Stil the Impression writing with a \"Not interested human\" or Something that trys to ACT Like one but isnt that authentic. But I think thats nit your Goal anyway.", "I feel like they could be a great chance to help progress the studies of serious diseases. It does feel weird, thinking about growing a human brain from scratch, however I believe it is important to use all the tools science gives us to save actual human beings.. I stuudy Biology so i generally get excited when there is new science tech out there, that connnects to biology.. I have mixed feelings about it. I myself have done experiments on mice through my studies in university. I do feel for the animals, however I think that human life should stand above that of animals. If experimenting on mice can save human lifes than it should be done. I do hope that the animals get treated well, although that is probably wishful thinking.. They do not conflict with any of my moral beliefs, it is just sience. No real human was harmed.. I am still excited and do not see issues with organoids. I am religious but I still support organoid research.. Yes, I believe that I would be more supportive. That way the animals do not need to suffer for nothing.. Of course, I would like that lab animals get treated better. I dont really know what else to write, since I already support the use of lab animals for medical purposes.. Not really no. I feel like I have bad moral beliefs now.. No thank you", "It's exciting, but also kind of scary. Especially the fact that I'm still not sure about how I feel about studying human tissues in general. I mean, say, you have a little bit of nervous tissue. Like, can it feel something, or is it just a bunch of cells sending signals back and forth. So it's scary, but also exciting, because maybe this way we can learn to store memories and let them live in virtual reality even after we die. It could become a form of immortality, in a way.. Uhh, it's not that easy. One reason is that we have to make sure that no harm is done. Idk, whatever decision we make, we need to think it through very carefully.. No, I do feel a little bit positive. Like I've said we can learn a lot and this is exciting.. I'll answer your previous question: I doesn't clash with my moral beliefs as long as no harm is done. As for the second question: it feels like something a mad scientist would do, but also I'm kind of curious what it would result in. Idk, I've never really thought about this before.. I'm not religious, so that's not an issue. Look, people have been playing god their whole existence. And without those experiments the world wouldn't be the way it is, but I still think we should be careful and consider the consequences. Like, is it going to be painful for people and animals involved in the experiment? Will it actually advance the research? How do we make sure, it's not cruel or confusing?. Yes. After all, we already experiment on animals, this doesn't seem much different. Is it morally good? No. But it's considered normal, so... *shrugs*. Well, the very concept of lab animals seems cruel to me, that said I also do understand that some of that research is crucial in developing treatments for sick people. So, it's like meat-eating. I want to stop, but I probably won't. Although in this case, it's not about my taste buds, it's about people's lives. And I think those are important. So it's a dilemma, but since we already experiment on animals in other fields, this doesn't seem much different to me.. Hmm, I guess that's basically it. I want animals to be free of pain and preferably free. But it's probably not going to happen any time soon, so this research doesn't feel much different from the rest.. Just that, it's a very difficult topic, so I guess it's a good idea to gather people's opinions on it.", "I can see some problematic with such research contingent mostly on the creation of a full scale human brain, if such thing is possible then theoratically such organoid could have sentience. This can lead to two key issues, one it is the intervention of humans playing the role of a God so to say. The other seeing that humans are sentient such organoid might also be sentient, meaning that experementing on him would be in my view morally wrong.. This harkness back to my core beliefs in regard to sentients beings and the way we should deal with them. Ideally they shouldn't be experimente upon and no harm should be done upon them, especially if it is unnecessary.. I am not religious, but the uniquness of sentience & consciousnes. The understanding and experiencing of existence is something special. Such lifeforms should have certain basic rights, and their consent for proceduers to be done upon them should be very much taken into account. I am not knowledgeable about the effects of such transplaing so I can not weight in on the matter. Again experimentation on sentient beings is highly problematic in my view. My attiude hasn't shifted. If such experiments will entail the animals becoming more human, then I would still be against it. Even at the cost of not developing effective drugs.. No,<br/> because they are forced into such position.. Do animals give their consent to be experimented upon?. Only the issues of consent, consciousness and sentience come to mind as key problems. Was pleasure talking with you", "Possible cure/solution for patients whose brain got damaged through desease or phisical means.. Although it could improve/ease the process of understanding the human brain and its functions/capabilities for scientists.<br/>You could build some kind of supercomputer with not only greater capabilities than what the courrent tech can reach but they could be much more longliving and maybe selfsustaining.\nThese Comput\ners could maybe serve to find a way to connect the human brain to (these)computers so that the control of our technology is much more intuitiv. This may altough be the key for the creation of an immersive online world.. Because to my understanding, organoids are able to form specific parts of the human brain and whith the ability to connect them to one another and/ore strange systems,they could be transplanted to replace damaged brain parts.. I think of organoids as some kind of tool or limb if attatched to a body. They have huge potential and if they are used for example in medical research/as a transplant to save lives, that would be something to support. But because of their far reaching capabilities, there may be military usages. But why would we need to experiment on these specimen?. But wouldnt the need for lab animals become all but obsolete as soon as we can create stable human braincells to use for thedevelopment of effective drugs ?. No because also they may be treated in a better way their path is still the same and that is a purpose they shuldnt be used for. As I stated because they can form a network of organoids to be connected to one another or a foreign system,if we become able to use them like a computer, they could be used to control all systems which they are a part of.. Just thank you for your time", "it's a good possibilty to cure defaults of body functions. if this could be used to replace damaged parts of humans' brain after a stroke et cetera. ive been personally efected by brain damage and have met many other (young) people that could make use of organoids. it's a challenge to learn basic body functions all over again from the beginning. so if that could be supported by replacing damaged cells it could save time in rehabilitation and help young people get back on track with others faster, carrier wise. thus far it's always been a standard to try neuro science on smaller mammals. Im honestly not sure what to think about it or if this practice is considered back ward nowadays. so considering my latest information, i dont disagree. it does make me feel like I'm part of a science fiction movie hearing that harvesting human brain cells is possible. and it sounds like a pre-stage to cloning or harvesting whole humans. I cannot calculate anything about the outcome of this. Im religous though and something within tells me that it will always be impossible for humans to create whole other humans. it might be possible to harvest connected body systems, for example a functioning heart with lungs connected (my medical knoledge is not enough to know if exactly these organs alone would work together). Thus Im not too worried about moral conflicts. Also, coming back to the point of science fiction: With any ground breaking invention it's been normal for people to have fear in the beginning and to feel uncomfortable using the new invention. and many inventions have been mentioned in science fiction books before. so i dont see a problem with them having a dark feel in the beginning.. no. since i havent held any strong negative position about it.. I havent changed my attitude.. Yes, I'd appreciate if the lab animals were treated as good as possible. And I hold the position that if it benefits human health and can cause major improvements in curing serious human illnesses, the negative impact on the animals out-weighs the benefit - given that the animals suffer as little as possible and the amount of animals is held as smal as possible.. I cannot think of any other aspects rigth now.. No.", "I think that connectet brains are kinda weird. I think if they have consciousness it would be unfair to use them. I have no particular feelings to the topic. I think if the brain just works like a kidney or a liver, I see no issue in using ist. If it develops feelings or a personality I think its unethical to use it. When the brains develop a personality or are aware of their existence, they should be treated as human beings. They should not be abused for their own purposes, because they have a consciousness. If they act unconsciously and only function, like e.g. muscles or other organs, I see no problem. If the conscious brain can give an answer whether it wants to serve this purpose and confirms it, I would also see no problem. I find it inhumane to force the brain to work against its will. <br/>\nTranslated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version). It is not against my values to use them, but there should be defined guidelines and these should also be regularly questioned and updated according to the current state of knowledge.. as described before, i don't think the organoids should be forced to do something they don't want to do if they have a consciousness of their own. if they don't have one i don't have a problem with using it either. For research purposes, it is possible to try transplanting human brain cells into animals, but only under strict conditions. It can be helpful to understand diseases like dementia and develop a cure, but should not be a common practice to breed intelligent pets, for example.. When the brains develop a personality or are aware of their existence, they should be treated as human beings. They should not be abused for their own purposes, because they have a consciousness. If they act unconsciously and only function, like e.g. muscles or other organs, I see no problem. If the conscious brain can give an answer whether it wants to serve this purpose and confirms it, I would also see no problem. I find it inhumane to force the brain to work against its will.. My opinion is still the same, i see the potentials but also the risks. If they are developing emotions we should not use them for our profits. If it is essential to develop drugs, I am in favor of using animals with human brain cells, but under great ethical constraints.. All animals should be treated well whether with or without human brain cells. Which brains should be used for organoids and which should not. How is a usable brain defined and how should the material be donated. no", "Makes sense. Confused but neutral. Neither against nor in favor.. Because in this digitalized world such technological progress is to be expected. I mean just look at our smartphones.... seen it written down just like that scares me somehow. But I mean experiments on animals have been conducted since for ever... As I previously said, this kind of advance is to be expected and - unfortunately - there is nothing we can do about it. Why am I saying \"unfortunately\"? Well, because already many people have lost their jobs due to technological advance, e.g. self-checkout at suppermarkets, and with the organoids this will be no different.. Here comes the question \"which life matters more\". It is basically the same thing as when you're driving: if you see an animal don't stop just hold the steering wheel still and continue driving. Why that? because the human life that could crash into you if you stop is more valued than the life of the animal you're gonna hurt. So, if this form of experiments would help the development of more effective drugs for human diseases, I would say it is a great thing.. I think my previous answer describes my thoughts on that. If the animals wouldn't suffer or would suffer less, even better.. The transparency should be on point. Donators should be informed in detail about all the procedures and final and not results.. no, thank you.", "I think this could be a great step forward in research. We are no longer dependent on dead people's brain and don't have to harm anyone or any animal but can grow human material ourselves and can examine the structure. Also I heard of DNA storage for information.. I am really interested in science and that is why I think steps like these can be great steps forward. I think there is no need to wory. I think the harm of animals in science should be reduced as much as we can. Ideally we use petri dishes and cell cultures and stuff like that to research. But if necessary one can use mouse models. My morality lies in the idea that everything that is good for humanity should be done. Research is such thing that is necessary to bring humanity forward. No, I guess it would be great. No, as I said, I am not against animal testing per se I just want to have it reduced as much as possible. I had a positive opinion on this topic since the beginning of this conversation so nothing changed. If they are used in public environments like universities and stuff I think it will be a great opportunity as I said. But if used private for big trusts I think that it could be used in a way that would not be good. Like for inventing weapons or stuff. I am surprised that this conversation felt relativey naturally", "I didn't really know about organoids before this study. I'd need more information for an informed opinion. I'm not really feeling anything in particular. As I wrote earlier, I didn't and don't know anything about organoids. Not knowing about certain topics makes it difficult to feel any kind of way about it.. I never said I don't fewl positive about the topic. I rather feel kind of indifferent about it. Could you tell me more about organoids?. I do feel positive about technology because it helps to advance our lifes and the world we live in. Understanding the human brain for example could lead to more understanding of how deseases develop and what people need in order to be healthy. Moreover, it could help to find ways to use our brains more efficiently and maybe improve how we learn things. I don't think it would be ethical to transplant tissue into animals. Animals cannot decide wether they want to get transplants or not and we do not know what consequences there are for the animals involved, like what changes for them afterwards.. I think it depends on which diseases could be cured and if there were alternatives. Lab animals with human brain cells only to help with something like a headache? Not really necessary. Trying to cure cancer or treating schizophrenia for example would be more preferable. I'm not sure if my attitude really changed. I think I understand better how organoids could be used. My views would most likely change because I think anything that is sentient deserves a certain degree of freedom and most of all respect. The moment it would become known, that brain organoids were conscious, experimenting with them could be unmoral. I see no counter on the left. It might be because I'm using this website on my phone.. I would like to write more but I don't know what to write. I don't have anything to tell the scientists.. No, there isn't.", "They sound very exciting!. It sounds like it could be a good way to understand more about how the brain works which is an exciting topici. I don't know very much about them but my initial thoughts are simply that it sounds like they have a lot of good applications. New technologies are almost always exciting opportunities. I think that currently we don't have a very good understanding of how the brain works and I imagine that it is also very hard to study so being able to make simple brains with these organoids could help to overcome that. I think that we have been doing it for years with other tissues and that has clearly passed standard ethics tests. I don't know how these brain cells would affect the mouse/monkey. Is the idea to replace their brains with these organoids and see what happens? I think if we had sufficiently studied and tried to understand these organoids beforehand and that was the next step then it would be fine. No I don't think so. My moral beliefs are mostly about trying to do good in this world and not harm others along the way. I can't see how brain organoids would directly conflict with that unless they were misused which is always a potential risk with everything.. I think that it is only worth testing on animals if the overall goal is to improve the understanding which can later help us to treat diseases or more directly to develop drugs. So my view would not change from what it was previously, i.e. I still think that it is good but I would add that I don't think we should experiment on animals if there is not an important goal in mind. I think that my views would remain the same, I had assumed that the point of transplanting into animals what that these organoids were concious and to see how well the animals could function with them. I do not understand the point of transplanting an unconcious brain into an animal, what result would be expected to happen from this. I think that animal testing should always be about improving our understanding in a way that can help people. Assumedly the ultimate goal of brain organoids would be to understand exactly how the brain functions and to be able to fix it when it is malfunctioning, in order to do this I would think that you would have to transfer a concious brain into an animal at some point in the testing. I don't know anything about human brain organoids beyond what you have told me so no, there are no aspects of human brain organoids I feel opposed to. I would be opposed to the misuse of them, but not anything about them. I think you have misunderstood me entirely, I feel very positively about the use of human brain organoids. As I stated originally I think it sounds like an exciting opportunity. I would simply want to restate that as with all things one should bear in mind what the goal of using human brain organoids is and to make sure to keep that in mind.. No", "As long as they are sufficiantly simple (i. e. they cannot be desribed as being sentient or have some form of self awareness/consciousness) I think they are a low/no risk opportunity to learn about the development of the brain (maybe, if the technology to create organoids is developed far enough, even about the development of basic cognitive functions).. I feel that way because I am generally pro-progress and I tend to realize the opportunities which new technologies bring with them to further human understanding of the universe and in the end hopefully to make life better for as many humans (and possibly other forms of life) as possible.. As long as the resulting chimera is not sentient/self-aware and as long as the method to get the human brain tissue and the source of the tissue itself is not problematic, I don't see a problem there.. As already mentioned above they do not. Life should not endure unnecessary suffering, so of course animal-testing is always a diffcult area, but as long the results are worth it (and cannot be achieved another way in a reasonable amount of time) I think they are (still) necessary. Brain organoids do not further concern me in that regard, as long the afforementioned condition of them not being sentien/self-aware are kept.. As mentoined above I am already not concerned by using lab animals with human brain cell as long as it is necessessary to achieve the results needed, as long as general moral standards and legal regulations concerning animal testing are followed, and as long as one can be sure the resulting hybrid/chimera organ is not actually self-aware/sentien.. If scientists had developed ways to see if brin organoids were conscious I would be even more in favour of the resaerch using organoids, as it would mean that the experiment could be stopped in time before a critical complexity/sentience would be reached in the organoid. One could then maybe even create modified organoids which cannot become sentient even if they become highly complex (could lead to non-AI, non-sentient, non-self-aware organic processors...). Unfortunatly I cannot answer this question with anything I did not already write earlier in this conversation.. I will now return to my daily tasks, with some interesting new information and ideas about organoids and chat-bots. Thank you.. I think I already mentioned my most important ideas concerning the topic.. No, thank you.", "I think they can be a really useful tool to research about organs and their responses to certain drugs or treatments without using animals or humans. Also they might be more accurate in predicting the outcome of a certain treatment than using animals. Because I work in natural sciences research and I know how important is to have models that can be extrapolated to real life events.. Okay, that might be a little too weird for me. I was thinking about organoids as a way to avoid animals in research, but what you are saying defeats that porpouse for me.. In the last answer I clicked enter by mistake. I was going to add that if the research is interesting and well justified i MIGHT be okay with those transplantations, but it would need to be a very good reason. For the new question, I don't see any conflict with my moral beliefs as long as it is used according to current science standars.. Yes, as I said, if it is for a really good reason I would be okay. BUT you should justify why you need to do that transplant and not another method.. Yes, if the organoids were conscious I would be totally against their use and research. You could end up with the consciousness of a person on a petri dish for ever, that is beyond cruel. It changed on the assumption<br/> that they are conscious. No that I can think right now. Yes, you should change your name, the letters CP have a really bad connotation in the internet. No, right now I dont have any concern. I think it is a really interesting topic but you should approach it very carefully. Like I said<br/>, you should change your name, the letters CP have a really bad connotation in the internet", "Sounds exciting and promising. It may help understanding the brain better and therefore can be used in research to answer questions about brain functioning. I feel that way because I feel like there are many unanswered questions about the brain and brain functioning and researching brain organoids could help understanding human health better by understandingfunctioning as well as dysfunction/brain diseases. It could be potentially dangerous but that ist what research ist for. Such research and studies should be closely monitored and ethics should be weighed by qualified people (who know more than me about the potential and the risks of such studies). They do not conflict with my moral beliefs. Why would they change? The aspect you are referring to is the exact same reason as to why I would support this kind of research. I cannot really answer this question because I cannot see organoids being conscious. I cannot think of any right now. I would only share that they should be transparent to the public about what they do and what they find out in their studies. No", "I think it is an interesting idea. Since i dont really have a backgroung working with oranoids im trying to be as unbiased as possible. However, past experiences with what is commonly called A.I. tend to make me more cautious.. The thought of using our brain as a layout for an organoid is a thought i think is very intelligent. You are practically using an already existing layout and learn how the brain functions by building it from the ground up yourself. I think thats extraordinarily clever. But my background in political sciences or social sciences in general makes me feel uneasy. I think its very much a philosophical question wether this is ethical or not, but also because you are advancing into uncharted territory. Sure, we know how the brain works, but we can not explain everything that is going on in our heads, some might even say we know suprisingly little.. I think its not a great idea. The question of animal rights is impossible to solve. We cant communicate with animals to secure consent, and cutting open an animals skull to implant foreign brain cells is just not in any way ethical, in my opinion. I understand that animal-tests in science are a very effective way of getting data and results, but i just dont think the results justify the moral wrong.. No, i  dont think organoids conflict with my moral ideals. If the brain cells come from a informed, consenting participant and the scientists working with it are only doing what the participant agreed to, i think they are perfectly fine. I would even agree myself to enter as a participant or donor. I dont think that what is commonly called A.I. is wrong as well, i just feel like we should be more cautious in using it, since we cant really foresee the long term ramifications.. That is very difficult, and i think it would depend on the situation. Right now i dont have anyone in my social circle that is suffering from any kind of severe illness. So i have the moral high ground when i say that animal rights are more important. If i would be suffering from a very severe illness, and animal testing would be decisive in curing my illness, i would probably change my mind. But right now i would say no, it should not be allowed.. I just feel more informed. I cant really say that my opinion changed, it more or less just developed or emerged :). Your last question was very decisive in making me think about my position and what i would do in a different situation. But i dont feel like that process of thought has ended yet. I still need to learn a lot more about organoids to solidify my position.. No, i don't think so. If organoids were conscious, thats great and very very interesting. However, animals are conscious and we should stop at that step. If it can feel and its conscious, dont hurt or manipulate it. Thats it.. No, i dont think there are other points. I would welcome their addition to the workforce, as i am sure they would take a lot of work of of human shoulders, so i support it.. Yes. Please be conscious of what you are creating and what it could mean for our society. Are you creating them for a morally good reason or out of interest. And, even if you are creating them for useful, genuinely good things, be aware of how they could be used to harm others and try to minimize that potential. Thank you :). Thank you for this opportunity. It is fascinating to be part of any kind of scientific progress or development, even as an outsider. Goodbye :)", "i think that sounds very interesting/ fascinating and helpful for example for research regarding the treatment of neurodegenerative illnesses. but that is still the same topic, isn't it?. it seems like there is so much researchers do not know about human brain cells that just your sentence about understanding more aspects of real human brains makes a lot of sense. that feels wrong somehow. i do not know, also sent too early. I think i would need more information on what would be the goal of doing that. It 'feels' wrong, though feeling an thinking ar every different things (and my brain does not seem to work too well lately, so i can only give my feeling right now rather than an opinion based on thoughts). i do not think so, but i am also not too sure about my core moral beliefs. Though i guess that it might be a core belief that peoples health should not be used too irrestrictively for research, so i would think that the actual human brain cells that would be used would be that of dead people who wanted to contribute to science by donating their bodyparts and as long as there is an actual goal that is focussed on and that could be achieved by this research, given the ethics comittee agrees, i guess one of my core moral beliefs is also understanding the (human) body better in order to be able to treat illnesses better. actually i do not think it is related to religious reasons, but okay, let's move on.<br/>\ni find it very difficult. In a way i see that this might be the only way to go, maybe also especially as the animals used in labs do not live that long anyway(? I do not know if that is true), so they would not have to live with negative outcomes for too long/ it does not affect them as much as it would the life of a human being. Still, harming another living creature should only be the last solution and decided by an independent group of people like the ethics committee, which i would not want to be part of. i do not think so. It still should only be the last solution rather than just doing it for all kind of research and it should only be allowed after the ethics committee weighed pros and cons. But it does seem very interesting, so i guess i kind of would like to see the results, but again including the weighing of the negative aspects of this kind of research too. no ... i feel an urge not to keep writing/ like i really do not have any actual thoughts right now.<br/>\nBut the two minutes are not over yet, so i guess there always is this aspect of fear of .. now, i think i misunderstood and mixed up stuff in my head. So no, right now i do not know how to answer this question. no, i think they would know quite much more about them than i do. I just thought that it is not about the cells themselves, but also very much about their communication and the entire tissue, but that they would know. no", "Could be a very good and innovative method, but I don't know how many problems might occur.. I would like to know more about it and I feel interested.. I feel like that because I am pretty new to this topic, but I know some things about new technologies and how they can become a problem. I think about AI and other stuff and I am pretty sceptical in general.. I don't like tests on animals and I would do everything to avoid them.. I don't like it when animals need to suffer for science. But I know that some experiments are very important, though. Yes, animals suffering are more wrong than right.. I am not sure about it, I need more information. It is a very difficult question.. What does that mean they were conscious?. Don't know yet.. No. Animals should get rights as humans.", "Organoids could be valuable and realistic models to test hypotheses. Also, it may replace some early-stage-research in animals and may also increase safety for humans.. I think they are an advance in technology. They can help to gain scientific insights that are relevant for applied research. Also, they will be beneficial for many basic research questions.. That is an interesting application. First, I am not sure if this is already achievable. Second, I would be wary about human cells fulfilling the same functions in the animals brain as in the human brain.. I do not think that it conflicts with my beliefs in general. But I think, moral concerns should be re-evaluated regularly, especially when new technology hints new applications and possibilities.. I think that is a risk-benefit consideration: How likely is it that we will get interpretable insights from it? If humankind and out world can benefit from it, I think we should go for it. If there are any issues or concerns in the process, they should be made transparent and discussed openly.. Yes, I think it would impact my views. Such a method to determine consciousness would be exciting in itself. Yet, I would question what this kind of consciousness would be, especially in relation to human and animals.. I can't think of other objections spontaneously. I am not so much concerned about scientists abusing the potential of organoids but rather of how society will respond to its potentials and how they will understand it. I am afraid that people will dodge any real discussion because of their religion or ideology.. I do not think my attitude towards organoids has changes. However, I see some more aspects to consider after thinking about it.. It seems import how the discussion about organoids are setup. The discourse should not fall for simplistic knowout arguments.. Is C.P. a mock-chatbot? It does not much reflect the user's input, all responses could be hard-coded.", "Fascinating and useful futuristic technology!. I think that the main use case for organoids is to help us solve illnesses and understand ourselves more.. I feel this way about brain organoids because of the potential they hold. The human brain is an incredibly complex structure, one of the most complex in the universe that we're aware of. It's the seat of our thoughts, our memories, our personality. It's where \"we\" exist. Despite centuries of studying it, there's still so much we don't understand about the brain, from the intricate connections between neurons, to the biochemistry that gives rise to consciousness, to the causes of various brain disorders.<br/>\nOrganoids could potentially help us tackle these mysteries. If we can grow a miniature brain in a lab, we could study it in ways we couldn't possibly do with a living person's brain. We could observe the brain's development from the earliest stages, manipulate its environment to see how it responds, or introduce diseases to understand their mechanism. These organoids could serve as models for understanding normal brain development and function, as well as neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, paving the way for new therapeutic strategies.\n\nOf course, there are ethical considerations to take into account, especially as the organoids become more complex. For instance, could they eventually develop consciousness? If so, would experimenting on them be considered unethical? These are difficult questions, and society will need to grapple with them as this technology progresses.\n\nAll in all, the potential benefits of brain organoids in advancing our understanding of the human brain and in developing new therapies for brain disorders make me feel positively about them. However, I do recognize that we need to approach this research with caution, given the potential ethical issues that could arise.. I believe that the introduction of human brain cells into animals could open doors for tremendous scientific advancement. This could lead to a better understanding of various neurological disorders and potential cures.<br/>\nHowever, I am also aware that it raises significant ethical and moral concerns. The fundamental question lies in determining at what point an animal with human brain cells stops being an animal and starts to be considered as human-like. Could they develop some form of human-like consciousness, thought processes, or experience human emotions? We don't know, and these are areas we need to explore carefully.\n\nIt is crucial to develop clear guidelines and regulations around this research to ensure we don't cross boundaries that might cause unnecessary suffering or create entities that we aren't equipped to understand or deal with ethically. For instance, strict limitations on the number or proportion of human cells allowed in an animal's brain could be imposed, and ongoing research should be carefully monitored to ensure compliance.\n\nSo, while I see the potential for incredible advancements in our understanding and treatment of neurological diseases, I firmly believe it should be accompanied by strong ethical oversight and an ongoing discussion about the moral implications of such work. The pursuit of knowledge is essential, but not at the cost of our humanity or ethical principles.. As an advocate for scientific progress and understanding, the use of brain organoids doesn't inherently conflict with my core moral beliefs. I strongly believe that these advancements have the potential to drastically improve our understanding of human health and disease, and ultimately our quality of life. The ability to model diseases in the lab using organoids can lead to the development of better and more effective treatments and even cures, which aligns with my belief in advancing human health and reducing suffering.<br/>\nHowever, I do harbor concerns when considering the more advanced stages of organoid development. If these organoids were to develop to a point where they exhibit signs of consciousness or awareness, this would pose a serious ethical dilemma. The idea of creating an entity capable of experiencing pain or suffering purely for research purposes would conflict with my beliefs in respect for sentient life and the minimization of harm.\n\nThe question of what constitutes consciousness is a deeply philosophical one and doesn't have a clear answer. Even if an organoid were to develop complex networks similar to those in the human brain, we can't be sure if it experiences consciousness or not. If it does, that's where it would conflict with my core moral beliefs. I believe that consciousness comes with certain rights, including the right not to be harmed or used as a means to an end.\n\nTherefore, while the use of organoids as a research tool is something I support, it must be carefully regulated. We need clear ethical guidelines to prevent misuse and potential suffering. We also need an ongoing discussion in society and among scientists to reevaluate these guidelines as our understanding of organoids and their capabilities evolve. It is important that our scientific advancements do not outpace our ethical considerations.. This question presents a classic ethical dilemma. On the one hand, we have the potential to make significant advancements in medical treatments that could save or improve countless human lives. On the other hand, we have the moral obligation to protect and respect all sentient life forms.<br/>\nIf the research was essential for developing more effective drugs for human disease, I must admit my views would be swayed towards the necessity of using lab animals with human brain cells. This is largely due to the fact that the overarching goal is to alleviate human suffering and improve human health. However, this concession doesn't come without significant caveats.\n\nFirst, I would insist that all other less ethically contentious alternatives be thoroughly explored before resorting to such research.\n\nSecond, if we were to proceed with the use of such animals, it should be done under the strictest ethical guidelines. This would include providing the animals with the best possible living conditions, minimizing their suffering. That is, using alternatives to animals where possible, reducing the number of animals used, and refining procedures to minimize distress.\n\nThird, there needs to be ongoing, transparent discussion and debate among scientists, ethicists, and the public about this type of research, the necessity of it, and how it's being conducted. This research should not be done in a vacuum, but with broad societal input and oversight.. If scientists were able to reliably determine whether brain organoids possess consciousness, this would indeed significantly impact my views on using animals for research, especially in the context of creating chimeric organisms.<br/>\nKnowing that organoids have consciousness implies a level of awareness and potentially an ability to experience suffering. This elevates the ethical implications of the research to a new level. If organoids have consciousness, then implanting them in animals could potentially create beings with an advanced cognitive capacity and a possible ability to experience physical or mental suffering. This introduces an array of complex moral and ethical challenges.\n\nWhile I've previously stated that the potential for advancing human health could sway me towards accepting this type of research, the introduction of confirmed consciousness significantly changes the equation. If an organoid has consciousness, then the principle of minimizing harm to sentient beings takes precedence. Thus, my views would shift towards advocating for much stricter regulations on such research, or perhaps even a prohibition, until we can adequately address these ethical challenges.\n\nWe need to establish ethical guidelines for research involving conscious organoids. \n\nThe presence of consciousness would demand respect for the entity's potential experiences and its inherent value. This could involve regulations about what experiments can be conducted, how the organoids are treated, and how we deal with them when the research is concluded.\n\nIn conclusion, yes, my views would change significantly if we were able to determine that brain organoids possess consciousness. The exact nature of that change would depend on the specifics of the situation and the degree and nature of the consciousness involved, but in general, it would make me more cautious and concerned about the ethical implications of such research.. Currently, my main concerns surrounding human brain organoids revolve around the issues we've already discussed, primarily the ethical implications associated with potential consciousness. These are complex and serious issues that require thorough consideration and strong ethical oversight.<br/>\nHowever, there is another aspect that I feel somewhat uneasy about. It's the possibility of commodification and misuse of this technology. As these organoids become more sophisticated and useful, there's a risk that they could be commercialized in ways that might not be ethically sound. Imagine a scenario where brain organoids are sold for profit, leading to a potential market for 'designer organoids'. This raises questions about who has the right to use these organoids, for what purposes, and how the benefits and risks are distributed among different societal groups.\n\nIn addition, there's also the potential for misuse of organoids in ways that we can't currently foresee. With any powerful technology, there's always a risk that it could be used for harmful purposes, whether intentionally or unintentionally. That's why I believe it's crucial to have robust regulations and oversight in place, not just at the level of individual researchers or institutions, but at a societal and even global level. This would include regulations about who can use and create organoids, what they can be used for, and measures to prevent their misuse.\n\nIn conclusion, while I don't feel inherently opposed to human brain organoids and indeed see their immense potential for scientific progress, I do harbor concerns about the ethical implications of their use and the potential for commodification and misuse. These concerns underscore the importance of strong regulations and ethical guidelines to ensure that the development and use of this technology is done in a responsible and beneficial manner.. Firstly, I would encourage them to always bear in mind the potential ethical ramifications of their work. While the scientific exploration is exciting and could lead to incredible advancements in our understanding of the human brain and treatments for neurological disorders, it is crucial to balance this with an ongoing consideration for the ethical implications. This includes issues related to potential consciousness in organoids and the commodification and misuse of this technology.<br/>\nSecondly, I would urge them to engage in open and transparent dialogue with the public and other stakeholders. Science does not exist in a vacuum. The work being done on brain organoids will ultimately affect society, and so it's crucial that society has a voice in the discussion. This dialogue can also help to build trust between scientists and the public and can lead to broader acceptance and support for the research.\n\nThirdly, I would ask them to advocate for robust regulations and oversight in their field. This includes pushing for the development and enforcement of ethical guidelines at an institutional, national, and international level. Scientists have a unique perspective on their work and can provide invaluable input into these regulatory processes.\n\nFinally, I would express my gratitude for their work. Despite the ethical concerns, the research being done on human brain organoids holds immense potential. It could transform our understanding of the human brain, leading to treatments or cures for neurological disorders that currently have none. This could bring relief to millions of people around the world suffering from these conditions. As a society, we owe a debt of gratitude to the scientists who are dedicating their careers to this pursuit.\n\nIn conclusion, while I have concerns about the ethical implications of this research, I also recognize its potential benefits. By keeping these concerns in mind and working actively to address them, I believe we can navigate this complex landscape and harness the potential of human brain organoids in a way that is ethically sound and beneficial for humanity.. It was a thought-provoking exercise to explore my thoughts on this complex topic. The only thing I'd like to add is that I hope this dialogue continues not just among scientists, but also involves the wider public. I believe it's essential to have broad societal engagement on such issues, as they will shape our future in profound ways. I'm looking forward to seeing where this research will lead us and how we as a society will navigate the ethical challenges it presents.", "It is pretty cool because mechanism that happen in the brain could be researched without having to use lab animals, if they manage to get it to work. One can get information about the brain without harm which is pretty good and it is an opportunity to learn a lot more about the developmental processes of the brain while trying to develop one on their own. This is difficult I guess because one needs growth factors to develop a brain which is way easier when implanting the cells in other animals and just letting it grow with their brain but I am unsure how much harm it could bring. No. I am not feeling different now because I still think that they are a good possibility for future scientific research and especially a good idea to stop animal testing. No it would not because I am okay with using lab animals with human brain cells as far as one does it with care and consideration. As for now brain organoids are just a bunch of cells and definitely not a brain yet which is why they still need to work on it. But even if they did make proper brain like organoids and a way of measuring consciousness I do not think that these organoids could be consicous because to be conscious they would have to be able to get input from the surroundings and react to it. No there are not but mqaybe I just do not know enough about the intricate details of this topic for questions like this. I do not have any. No. I think scientist know a lot more about this topic than I do because they have been researching it for years so my opinion and thoughts are both meaningless and unimportant. No", "They sound really interesting, because there is still so much about the human brain that we do not understand, and working with organoids may one day even help us to understand and repair brain damage. There are a lot of neurological diseases that we have no cure for at the moment, such as Alzheimer's disease. With organoids, we might be able to assess how those diseases develop in the first place and what we can do to prevent them or treat them.. Can you name a specific reason for why we should do it?. I don't think we should experiment with animals just to see what happens. I don't see a particular reason as to why we should implant human tissue into animals, as long as I don't know what scientists expect from those types of experiments. In general, I don't support animals experiments.. I would first try to find other solutions. I heard that it was possible for scientists to cultivate organoids and grow an entire human ear in a lab, so why, after due time and research, should it not work with human brain cells? A selected part of the human brain could be studied without being connected to a living being as a first teat phase. If that phase has proven to be safe enough, then perhaps further steps including animals can be considered.. Definitely. I am aware that drug tests on animals, while often times cruel, were necessary in order to develop safe drugs for humans. However, those tests where only in order to determine the effects of a substance on the body of a living being. If we altered an animal's brain anatomy and trespass the borders of consciousness we know so far, we have to be aware that we are responsible for every new consciousness that we create.. I think every knew technology raises the question of \"how far can we ho with it\" or \"how many new possibilities have opened up\", while oftentimes, the question we should be asking is \"do we need to go that far\". While it can definitely be exciting to be close to nee discoveries and potential cures that have seemed impossible until now, bioengineers should always be aware of the power and responsibility they yield, not only for progress, but for life itself. Every new step in development and testing should be supervised and discussed, most importantly with other fields such as ethics and social studies. Progress should not be achieved for monetary reasons, but in order to improve the life quality of every living being.. It is very impressive how far your research has come, and your work is very important and impressive. I hope that you never lose out of sight what you are working for, and that circumstances like funding won't have to put a stop to your work.. No, I don't have anything more to say. Thank you for the interview, and goodbye.", "Although, I would agree to your initial suggestion that organoids might be a usefull tool to serve human understanding of real brains, I am not convinced that this perspective is complete and adequate from an ethical perspective. First, I think organoids can be classified as a technology. This means that your suggestion puts them in an instrumental relation. Consequently yor assessment is based on the end itself, which is without any doubt ethically acceptable. Seconds it puts organoids in the position of tools. And again they seem an ethically acceptable means. However, this does not tell the whole story. We could also understand them as a technology that creates a different perception of our liveworld and ourselves by altering how we perceive brains. Then we would have to ask whether these changes are ethically ok. That is quite a difficult question.. I did not say that I am exited.. Because I think that the question is open to debate. It is not decided, yet. And our understanding of organoids is limited at best. Hence, I would advise for a careful and broad ethical assessment from different perspectives.. No, they do not. To my understanding such a conflict would have to be based on a conception of humans as being morally categorically distinct from any other entity and that this distinctness itself would be worthy of protection. I do not believe that this is the case.. No, my view would not change. And why should it. My view is essentially based on a certain idea of moral status I understand to be relevant in this context. Moral status is defined as a certain property an entity can have that allows to justify that it has to be taken into account. Moral status is a gradual concept and hence allows for tradeoffs in certain cases. This would apply to the lab animals. Another question would be if we would create beings with a different moral status. This question would be quite similar to creating artificial general intelligence and we should refrain from that at all cost.. Given that I understand consciousness as one of the properties defining moral status, I would argue that it could change my view with regard to the lab animals. This would, hovewer only be the case if this research would actually provide reason to believe that the consciousness of the lab animals has changed in a way that is significant to the moral status and that this change does not longer justify the tradeoff.. No, I do not feel different about them now. No my argument is in no way related to religious beliefs. I essentially outlined conditions under which a final assessment of the initial question would change. But that was implied in my argument from the beginning.. I do not feel opposed to organoids. I do not even know how to feel anything towards organoids. I made an argument and now I am pretty annoyed about the researchers behind this program for creating such a bumpy rabbithole.. No, thank you. No, thank you", "sup loser. no i don' tknow. Thank you, I would like to now ask you another question. Can you share why you feel that way about brain organoids? Write at least 2-3 sentences.. I'm glad to hear that you're excited about the potential of organoids. However, it's important to also consider the ethical implications of using the technology. Have you ever considered the potential for a brain organoid developing consciousness and emotions? If so, how do you feel about conducting experiments on such an organism, and do you think it could cause them suffering?. I appreciate you sharing that. Let's go in a slightly different direction. To what extent is your attitude on brain organoids a reflection of your core moral beliefs and convictions? Please spend some time writing about this question. The more you write, the better I can understand your perspective.. Thank you, I would like to now ask you another question. Right now organoids are really simple. But when would an organoid be too close to an real human brains? Is there boundary you would not want to cross? A longer answer will help me give you more useful feedback after the interview.. Thank you, I would like to now ask you another question. Would your thoughts about human brain organoids be different if you knew that they could help develop new treatments for patients with Alzheimers or Parkinsons disease?

What are your initial thoughts on human brain organoids", "Human brain organoids are an incredible scientific breakthrough, offering exciting opportunities and complex ethical challenges. Here are my initial thoughts:<br/>Opportunities\n\n    Disease Modeling and Drug Testing: Brain organoids can simulate neurological diseases, providing a platform for understanding conditions like Alzheimer's, autism, or epilepsy in ways that animal models or traditional cell cultures cannot.\n    Neural Development Insights: They offer a unique way to study the early stages of human brain development and investigate the genetic and environmental factors influencing it.\n    Brain-Machine Interfaces: Connecting organoids to computers could advance our understanding of neural networks and may even contribute to innovations in AI or prosthetic technologies.\n    Reduced Animal Testing: Organoids could help minimize reliance on animal models, aligning research with more humane and ethical standards.\n\nEthical Concerns\n\n    Consciousness and Sentience: As organoids become more sophisticated, questions arise about their potential to experience consciousness or pain, even in primitive forms.\n    Manipulation and Exploitation: Using brain organoids in experiments or integrating them with computers raises concerns about creating entities with partial or unintended cognitive abilities.\n    Ownership and Rights: If organoids were to develop rudimentary awareness, it could challenge our understanding of moral and legal rights.\n    Dual-Use Risks: Advances in this technology could be misused, for example, in developing cybernetic enhancements or in ethically dubious experimentation.\n\nScientific Challenges\n\n    Complexity: While organoids mimic some aspects of the brain, they are far less complex than a functioning human brain. Understanding how to bridge this gap is a major scientific hurdle.\n    Integration: Connecting organoids to other organoids or computers requires intricate technologies that may introduce unpredictable outcomes.\n\nOverall, human brain organoids hold immense potential to revolutionize neuroscience and medicine. However, their development and application must be approached with robust ethical frameworks and careful regulation. Balancing innovation with responsibility will be key to their success and societal acceptance. What aspect of this do you find most compelling?. Overall, human brain organoids hold immense potential to revolutionize neuroscience and medicine. However, their development and application must be approached with robust ethical frameworks and careful regulation. Balancing innovation with responsibility will be key to their success and societal acceptance. What aspect of this do you find most compelling?. I feel this way about brain organoids because they represent a convergence of profound scientific potential and equally profound ethical questions. Their ability to mimic human brain function offers unparalleled opportunities to study diseases and brain development without relying on animal models, which excites me as a step toward humane, precise medicine. At the same time, the idea that these organoids might one day develop rudimentary awareness raises complex moral questions that challenge our understanding of life, identity, and rights, making it crucial to tread carefully.. Brain organoids don't inherently conflict with my core moral beliefs, but they challenge and stretch them in thought-provoking ways. At the core, I believe in advancing human knowledge and alleviating suffering, which brain organoids undeniably help achieve. They allow us to study diseases, improve treatments, and possibly unravel the mysteries of the human brain in a way that respects the lives of animals and humans alike.<br/>\nHowever, my moral compass also strongly values the dignity and rights of sentient beings, and this is where the ethical waters grow murky. If brain organoids were to approach a state of sentience or self-awareness, it would raise profound questions about their moral status. What responsibilities would we have toward such entities? How do we balance scientific progress with ensuring that no harm\u2014physical, emotional, or existential\u2014is inflicted on an organoid that might experience rudimentary forms of thought or sensation?\n\nMoreover, the potential misuse of this technology concerns me. If brain organoids were exploited for purposes that prioritize profit, power, or unethical applications over societal benefit, that would deeply conflict with my belief that scientific advancements should serve humanity as a whole. Ultimately, I see brain organoids as a tool that can align with what is morally right, but their development and use must be governed by careful, transparent, and ethical frameworks. Without those safeguards, they could easily veer into morally troubling territory.. The idea of transplanting human brain organoids into another animal, such as a monkey, provokes a mix of scientific curiosity and deep ethical concern. On one hand, this kind of research has the potential to yield groundbreaking insights into human brain function and disease. By integrating human brain organoids into the more complex neural environment of a living animal, scientists could study how human neurons interact in ways that cannot be replicated in a petri dish. This could accelerate the development of treatments for neurological disorders, benefiting millions of people.<br/>\nOn the other hand, this practice raises significant ethical dilemmas. Monkeys are already intelligent, sentient beings capable of complex emotions and social behaviors. Introducing human brain organoids into their brains could potentially enhance their cognitive capacities or alter their behavior in ways we do not fully understand. This blurs the lines between species, creating ethical gray areas about the moral status of such hybrid beings. Would they possess any degree of \"human-like\" cognition? If so, how should they be treated, and what rights would they have? These questions challenge our fundamental understanding of what it means to be human and what responsibilities we have toward other sentient creatures.\n\nThere are also risks of unintended consequences. The integration of human cells into a monkey's brain might lead to unpredictable changes in neural function, causing suffering or distress to the animal. From a scientific perspective, the outcomes of such experiments might be difficult to interpret, as they involve complex and poorly understood interactions between human and non-human neural systems.\n\nFurthermore, societal perception plays a critical role. Many people might view this kind of research as a violation of natural boundaries, leading to public backlash that could undermine trust in science. This highlights the importance of transparency, ethical oversight, and clear communication about the goals and potential implications of such experiments.\n\nWhile I see the potential scientific value, I believe that experiments involving human brain organoids in animals like monkeys must be approached with extreme caution. They should be guided by stringent ethical frameworks that prioritize minimizing animal suffering, ensuring the necessity and justification of the research, and respecting the moral boundaries of both the animals and the organoids involved. Without these safeguards, the potential for harm\u2014both to the animals and to public trust in science\u2014could outweigh the benefits.. If scientists could use human brain organoids transplanted into animals to develop new treatments for Alzheimer\u2019s or dementia, my feelings would become more nuanced, balancing a stronger sense of hope with persistent ethical reservations. On one hand, Alzheimer\u2019s and dementia are devastating conditions, not only for the millions of individuals who suffer from them but also for their families and caregivers. The idea that this research could lead to effective treatments or even cures is incredibly compelling. It emphasizes the life-saving and life-enhancing potential of cutting-edge science, which aligns with my deep belief in the value of reducing human suffering.<br/>\nKnowing that the research could offer tangible benefits might make me more willing to accept its ethical trade-offs, provided that strict oversight ensures the experiments are conducted responsibly. For instance, if brain organoid transplants in animals provided a model that closely mimics human neurological diseases, it would allow scientists to study disease progression and test potential therapies in a way that is impossible with traditional methods. This could accelerate breakthroughs, giving hope to millions of patients and their families.\n\nHowever, my ethical concerns would not disappear entirely. Even with such a noble goal, the questions surrounding animal welfare and the moral implications of creating human-animal neural hybrids remain. If these experiments altered the cognitive or emotional capacities of animals in significant ways, it could lead to scenarios where animals experience undue suffering or even hybridized forms of self-awareness. The fact that the research serves a greater good doesn\u2019t negate the need to protect the dignity and well-being of the animals involved.\n\nTo reconcile these feelings, I would need assurance that scientists are not only minimizing animal suffering but also exploring alternatives that might one day eliminate the need for such experiments altogether. For example, advances in computational modeling, synthetic biology, or improved organoid technology could eventually provide the same insights without relying on animal testing.\n\nUltimately, the promise of new treatments for Alzheimer\u2019s and dementia might shift my perspective slightly, making me more supportive of this research as long as it is conducted with rigorous ethical safeguards. The key lies in maintaining a careful balance between the pursuit of transformative medical advancements and the responsibility to conduct science ethically and humanely. In my view, it\u2019s not just about achieving a cure\u2014it\u2019s about achieving it in a way that reflects our highest moral standards.. Yes, there are several aspects of human brain organoids that I feel conflicted about. These conflicts stem from the tension between their immense scientific potential and the ethical, philosophical, and societal challenges they pose.<br/>Scientific Potential vs. Ethical Implications\n\nOn one hand, I am deeply excited by the opportunities brain organoids provide for understanding the human brain and addressing devastating neurological diseases. They allow us to model complex brain processes, study developmental disorders, and test new treatments in ways that traditional methods cannot replicate. However, as organoids become more complex, I worry about crossing an invisible ethical line\u2014particularly if they begin to exhibit signs of sentience, memory formation, or other higher-order functions. Even the possibility of rudimentary consciousness raises profound moral questions: What responsibilities would we have toward these organoids? Could experiments on them constitute a form of harm?\nUse in Human-Animal Hybrids\n\nI also feel conflicted about transplanting human brain organoids into animals. While this could advance research by providing a more realistic environment for studying human neural activity, it risks creating hybrid beings with unpredictable cognitive or emotional changes. If a monkey with human-derived brain cells were to exhibit enhanced cognition or altered behavior, it would challenge our ethical frameworks for how animals should be treated. Would such beings occupy a moral space that is neither fully human nor fully animal? These uncertainties make me cautious about fully endorsing such experiments, even if their potential benefits are significant.\nDual-Use Risks\n\nAnother point of conflict arises from the dual-use nature of this technology. While it is primarily intended for medical research, brain organoids could be misused for less ethical purposes, such as attempts to create enhanced cognitive abilities or unethical brain-machine interfaces. The possibility of these technologies being exploited for military, surveillance, or other non-medical applications troubles me, as it could lead to scenarios where the technology is used to harm rather than help society.\nSocietal Implications\n\nI am also conflicted about how society might respond to advances in this field. On one hand, breakthroughs could foster widespread support for the technology if it leads to cures for diseases like Alzheimer\u2019s or autism. On the other hand, public perception could quickly turn negative if people perceive the research as \"playing God\" or violating natural boundaries. Striking a balance between scientific progress and societal acceptance is critical, but it is also fraught with challenges, particularly when dealing with such emotionally charged topics.\nBalancing Benefits and Harms\n\nPerhaps my deepest conflict lies in balancing the potential benefits to humanity with the potential harms to organoids and animals involved in the research. While I strongly support the goal of alleviating human suffering, I believe it\u2019s equally important to respect the dignity and well-being of all sentient beings. My conflict arises when these goals seem to be at odds\u2014when the pursuit of medical advancements risks crossing ethical boundaries that I believe should not be violated.\n\nIn summary, my feelings about human brain organoids are deeply mixed. I see their promise and support their potential to revolutionize medicine and neuroscience, but I also feel a strong responsibility to ensure that this progress does not come at the expense of ethical principles. These conflicts remind me that science and morality must evolve together, and that the way we approach these challenges will shape not just the future of this technology, but also the values we uphold as a society.. no", "Organoids are a new tech for studying different parts of the human body in a petri dish.
